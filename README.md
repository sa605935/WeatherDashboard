Unit 6 Homework - Weather Dashboard

https://sa605935.github.io/WeatherDashboard/

See folder named "live_website_screenshots" for images of working website deployed!

This website was created to view the current and forecasted weather of ultiple cities. In the deployed web page, the user can search for a city, see the current day's AND forecasted temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The site saves your search history to local storage, so the user can easily flip between searched cities to compare the weather.

I was able to meet all of the following acceptance criteria:

When the user searches for the city, it appears in the search history and displays the current and forecasted weather conditions. The UV index color changes based on the scale set to mimic the severity of the UV rays that day. I created custom weather icons in paint to go with the theme of the website and also provide easy to understand high-level weather conditions. When a previous search city searched is clicked, the user is again presented with that city's weather page.

I found this assignment a little less challenging than the previous assaingment. But still difficult to time manage since we are also working on our first team projects.
